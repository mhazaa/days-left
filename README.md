# Days Left

Days Left is a top-down shooter game. The goal is to kill as many monsters as possible. It uses the typical shooter mechanics, with a bullet count and reload time as well as a stamina meter, and the ability to annihliate all enemies on the screen three times per game. I programmed this on HTML5 canvas using JavaScript and the P5JS library.
